<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I’m Ayush Kumar Choudhary, a 2nd-year B.Tech student majoring in Computer Science and Engineering at MCKVIE. I have a passion for technology, coding, and problem-solving. Outside of academics, I love playing cricket and basketball, which helps me stay active and build teamwork skills. I’m also exploring my interest in software development and am eager to learn more about the ever-evolving world of computer science. When I'm not coding or on the field, you can find me exploring new tech trends and spending time with friends.</p>
